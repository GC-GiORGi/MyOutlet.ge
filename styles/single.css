The two highlights of this update are the new Profile feature in the in-game overlay, and an update for the mobile app introducing stats and UI changes.</p>\n\n\n<p>Viewable only by yourself and those on your friends list, the profile page sums up your Ubisoft journey and is a personal page dedicated to you as a player! Head to your profile page to find information like your username, avatar, current level and recently played games. You can also navigate to your friend’s profile page where it shows the same information and allows you to compare stats for games in common. This is just the introduction of the profile and it will continue to be developed further, with new features and aspects that we're excited to show at a later date!</p>\n\n\n<p>A notable update is also coming to the mobile app bringing the same detailed Stats feature that's available in the in-game overlay.

Created from Uplay and the Ubisoft Club, it’s become a place for friends to meet, compare their achievements, get rewards, and bring the Ubisoft community together across all of their devices and games. \n\nTo celebrate Ubisoft Connect’s one-year anniversary, let’s celebrate some of the ways it’s enabled players to enjoy their games and connect with each other across devices, and look ahead to upcoming features including cross-chat for Ubisoft Connect on mobile, and Share Play, which will let you share your game sessions with a friend on Ubisoft Connect PC. Share Play will launch with a beta test in the coming weeks, and is coming to the recently launched [Far Cry 6](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/66L79lBUba6BaMeejt5kW7/far-cry-6-out-now).\n\n<center><object width=\"700\" height=\"395\" data=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJdRNDLoqAY\"></object></center>\n\n__Cross-progression and Cross-play__       \nCross-progression is available for games released since the launch of Ubisoft Connect last year, and it lets you pick up and play your game on any device where you own a copy of the game. If you haven’t made the leap to the next generation of consoles just yet, or just like to switch up where you play, you can continue your game when you upgrade or move to another platform.  Play anytime, anywhere you own the game without ever having to start over just because you switched platforms. Cross-progression is available for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Immortals Fenyx Rising, Far Cry 6, and the upcoming Riders Republic.\n\nCross-play will let friends play together across different devices, and will debut on Ubisoft Connect with Riders Republic on October 28*. Wherever you and your friends play, you’ll be able to form teams or continue long-standing rivalries in any game where the feature is available. Cross-play will also come to Rainbow Six Siege on consoles in 2022.\n\n![UbiConnectRewards](//images.contentful.com/p0f8o8d25gmk/7dID1AkRVREBX1PiRlGVIy/a7b4fb019ff8167c5cd3dbe42003419f/UbiConnectRewards.png)\n\n__Rewards and Challenges__      \nThe improved loyalty program has been a key feature of Ubisoft Connect since its launch, helping you to get rewarded just for playing games with Units you can spend on Ubisoft Store discounts or exclusive in-game items unique to Ubisoft Connect. Weapons, skins, outfits, and more can be earned by completing actions in-game, which also increase your profile’s experience level so you can show off your gaming chops and prove to your friends that you’re the real champ.\n\nTake part in Community Challenges to unlock exclusive Rewards for all participants by combining efforts with others, or boost your level by joining in the weekly Time-Limited Challenges. Some Rewards don’t require any Units at all; just log into Ubisoft Connect and claim them. Since launch, there have been over 134 million Rewards collected and over 1.1 billion Challenges completed by the Ubisoft community, and with cross-game Rewards, players can even unlock cool gear for one game by completing challenges in another, like the Rewards offered for Rainbow Six Extraction in [Rainbow Six Siege’s recent Containment event](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3nr9Toe1H2siPRoB5VcRhp/rainbow-six-siege-containment-event-adds-new-nest-destruction-mode).\n\n__Cross-Chat Coming to Mobile__      \nThe Ubisoft Connect app on mobile already allows users to browse their library of games, Challenges, Rewards, and Stats, serving up the latest news about Ubisoft titles and allowing you to follow your in-game achievements, as well as those of your friends, wherever you go . To really bring players together across games and platforms, the Ubisoft Connect mobile app will soon feature cross-chat, allowing you to keep the conversation going with your friends whether they are playing a totally different game or on a totally different platform, and ensure you never miss an invite to play. \n\n__Share Play on Ubisoft Connect PC__       \nShare Play is a brand-new feature coming to Ubisoft Connect on PC which will enable you to share your play session with a friend and even let them take over the controls. If you’ve ever wanted to show off a new game to a friend, you now can with Share Play. Just  invite them into your game session for your own private, one-on-one stream, or let them take over and experience it for themselves.\n\nEver come across a boss you just can’t defeat, a trick you can’t master, or an item you just can’t reach? Pass the controller over to your skilled friend, even when they’re not in the same room, or even the same country, to overcome that bump in the road or give you some tips on how to play like a pro. You could even play single-player games together, passing the controller for each new level or each “game over” screen, or enter into your own private tournament, taking turns to see who can get the highest score or the fastest time. \n\nThe Share Play beta is coming to Ubisoft Connect PC in the coming weeks, and you will be able to use it with Far Cry 6 to explore Yara with your friend watching or let them take over when they just have to pet Chorizo for themselves.\n\n![FC6 SCREENSHOT FIGHSTREETS 07 960x540](//images.contentful.com/p0f8o8d25gmk/39qPaDOhHp63iyN3dI56WL/d6207e42d58a30897d8000745caa931c/FC6_SCREENSHOT_FIGHSTREETS_07_960x540.jpg)\n\n“Our vision in launching Ubisoft Connect was to focus on social interaction and ensure that our players get the best experience together, whichever Ubisoft games they play,” said Charles Huteau, creative director of Ubisoft Connect. “With the upcoming Riders Republic, people will be able to play with their friends on any platform and we want to continue to support cross-play wherever we can. With the introduction of a cross-chat and features like Share Play, it’s a great way to expand the social experience of our players and allow them to share that experience in a variety of ways. These days, play is not locked into a single platform and people want to share with each other, and we want to support that by helping players to share their passion and the worlds they are exploring with their friends across the globe.”\n\nYou can take advantage of all the features Ubisoft Connect offers right now by [downloading it for PC and mobile](https://ubisoftconnect.com/), or you can access it from within Ubisoft games on all platforms and on [the Ubisoft Connect website](https://ubisoftconnect.com/). For more on Ubisoft games and features, stay tuned to the [Ubisoft News hub](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/).\n\n*\\* Riders Republic will support cross-play and cross-generation play, allowing players to connect with friends and other riders on all platforms. When matchmaking with previous-gen players, next-gen players’ experience will be matched to previous-gen players, limiting the maximum number of players in a race to 20.*\n","mediaURL":"https://static3.cdn.ubi.com/orbit/uplaynews/_UplayNews2021/Random/UbisoftConnect_KeyArt_1504x282.jpg","mediaType":"None","links":[],"obj":{"markdown":"true","audience":"steam"},"summary":"Take a look back at one year of Ubisoft Connect and a look forward to what’s coming in the near future.\n","tags":["Other News"]},{"profileId":"0ede5486-cccc-47e5-b9cc-2ab03ddbe2b9","spaceId":"e17be87d-2996-4f3b-97c4-19bb2dae2933","newsId":"ignt.29565","type":"featured","placement":"_uplay_featured","priority":5,"displayTime":0,"publicationDate":"2022-01-07T00:00:00","locale":"en-US","title":"Last Chance!

She started drawing at a very young age, inspired by her childhood cartoons such as the Power Puff Girls, Tom & Jerry, Pixar movies, and more. In 2017, she discovered Rainbow Six Siege and fell in love with its characters, leading her to create Siege based artwork.\n\nWhile playing Siege, she often found herself in funny situations, and so in 2018 she started to share these moments on social media through small comics. Pericote didn’t expect her comics to be so popular, but she was delighted to see the Siege community show love and appreciation for them. While her popularity was growing, she had the opportunity to draw Kaid before the Operator was announced and also worked on the Siege Fifth Anniversary vinyl record in collaboration with other community artists.\n\nFrost being one of Pericote’s favorite operators, she wanted to create a bundle specifically for her. Her nickname, “Pericote”, means “rat” in her country and this is the reason why she added some rat-like features such as the whiskers on the mask. She also included cute and funny elements inspired by her comics, such as the Pericote weapon charm – really, it’s too cute.\n\nGo check out Pericote on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Pericote9) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/peri_pericote/) to see more of her awesome artwork and funny comics!\n\n<p><img src=\"https://static3.cdn.ubi.com/orbit/uplaynews/_UplayNews2021/RainbowSix/R6S_Y6S4_Artist%20Bundle_Prime.jpg\" /></p>\n\n### FAQ\n__What is the Community Artist Bundle Program?__\nThe Community Artist Bundle Program launched in Y6S1 and it brings operator bundles created by some of our most talented and dedicated Siege fan artists into the game.\n\n__I’m a Siege fan artist too – what can I do to get selected as well?__\nGiven the length of our production cycle for in-game content, the fan artists for Year 6 have already been determined. However, we are always on the lookout for future participants. If your goal is to see your bundle in-game, continue showing us your passion and strive to be an outstanding member of the Siege community. We have multiple ways for our dedicated community artists to get more involved with the game, such as the [Siege Champions Program](https://rainbow6.com/siegechampionsprogram).\n\n__How can I get the Y6S4 Pericote Operator bundle?__\nLink your Ubisoft account with your Amazon account [here](https://primegaming.ubisoft.com/) and claim the Operator set through [Prime Gaming](https://gaming.amazon.com/loot/rss?ref=_SM_R6S04_P9_TWL?ref_=SM_R6S04_P10_IGP) starting from December 14th.
